        "description": "Every day, our virtual environment becomes more populated and polluted; digital detritus accumulating as we create content and leave crumbs of our consumption. Caricature Cubes is a critical project which aims to highlight the absurdity of our impending virtualization of the real, question our aesthetic and social celebrations, and frustrate the images of our personalities.",

        "description": "The West Park House, located at the entrance to Ann Arbor's centrally located park, imagines a mode of co-living among groups whose traditional domestic requirements are considered incompatible. A family of four, a couple, and two solo occupants all share a single residence. The program of this house is organized by a regular interval of rectangular volumes which contain the principal domestic apparatuses for eating, sleeping, and bathing, and which also serve to break-up the footprint of each living space -- making ambiguous the nature of the varied domestic condition for each occupant. This project was first and foremost a study of the illustration style of MOS Architects.",

Alternatively, this relationship could be interepreted in reverse, as we consider the effects 3-dimensions have on the reality of the projected image. Once constructed, the scene was rendered permanent in hand drafted drawings, and the phenomenon was returned to 2-dimensions.",

The book is a deeply cultural artifact, filled with humanity's stories and which serves as a physical memory through additive manufacturing, specifically printing. This book offers a new paradigm of communication that represents oncoming technological change. The book was designed parametrically by sampling random noise to generate seeds which served as the centroid of each cell which radiates to form a Voronoi pattern. This pattern was duplicated in negative and positive along the head and tail of the book, adding to its complexity in fabrication.",

The only original documentation of the project were the plans and elevations, lacking any relationship to site, or labeling of program. This made for a very interesting study as we were left to interpret Terragni's disposition towards the domestic condition with nothing but plans, and the legacy of his work as the architect of the Casa del Fascio.",
